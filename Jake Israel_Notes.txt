Machine Learning intro.:

Modeling functions - input, given output
Linear Regression
Optimization and loss

k-NN - Unsupervised learning

Simple learning has drawbacks, so can turn to Deep learning

Non-linear transforms
Neural Networks - with hidden layers

Audio features

Introduce ML by grounding it in something real - a problem that ML can be used to fix

Music generation- maximum likelihood estimation (instead of modeling the function, model the distribution and can produce data for you)

Academics don't have enough processing power to train their own models, so are
